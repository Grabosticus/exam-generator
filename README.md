# exam-generator
A web application that generates new exams in the form and style of an old exam using a RAG model.

## How to start the application
Run `docker compose up --build` (or `docker-compose up --build`)
This installs all requirements and builds the application from the ground up. This might take some time.

If you just want to restart your application, run the command without the `--build` flag
