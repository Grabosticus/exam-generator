The frontend should kind of look/behave like this:

Homepage:
The homepage contains a list of all courses -> GET /courses
The user should have the option to create a new course -> POST /courses
    - The user should be able to click on a course and be redirected to the course's page -> GET /courses/COURSE_ID

Course Page:
The user should be able to click a "Upload Material" button.
    - While uploading the user should specify whether they upload slides, notes, or an exam.
    - When the user uploads the file, it should be sent to the backend -> POST /courses/COURSE_ID/upload/MATERIAL_TYPE
The user should be able to click a "Generate New Exam Button" -> POST /courses/COURSE_ID/generate
    - The user should then be able to download the returned PDF
